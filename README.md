# Training Session: Leveraging GitHub Copilot for Data Engineering

## Introduction

During this live hands-on session, participants will experience how GitHub Copilot can assist in boosting their data engineering workflows. The session will demonstrate essential data engineering processes using Python, Apache Spark, and SQL, all within Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code. Participants will also learn how GitHub Copilot can assist in generating queries and documentation.

## Create a Data Pipeline Project

1. Set up a new Python project in Jupyter Notebooks using Conda.
   - Create a Conda environment.
   - Install necessary packages: pandas, numpy, pyspark, etc.
2. Ingest data using Apache Spark.
   - Read data from various sources like CSV, JSON, and databases.
3. Transform data using PySpark.
   - Apply transformations such as filtering, grouping, and joining.
4. Load data into a SQL database.
   - Use SQLAlchemy to connect to a database and load the transformed data.
5. Generate SQL Queries using GitHub Copilot.
   - Demonstrate how Copilot can assist in writing SQL queries for data analysis and manipulation.

## Goals

The objective of this lab is to:

- Ingest data from multiple sources using Apache Spark.
- Transform data using PySpark and pandas.
- Load data into a SQL database.
- Generate SQL queries with the assistance of GitHub Copilot.
- Use GitHub Copilot to assist in writing code and generating documentation.
- Share the context of previous development and collaborate using GitHub Copilot Chat.

## Requirements

- Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda).
- VS Code version with Jupyter and GitHub Copilot Extensions enabled.
- Apache Spark setup.
- SQL Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) installed.
- SQLAlchemy and other necessary Python packages installed.
